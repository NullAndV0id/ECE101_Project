Hey Arron and Dr. Law, I made a little GitHub repo to manage this project a little easier. If you could send me an updated version
of this file once you're done on Friday that would be great. Also, arron, if you could send me the original un-combined schematic
of Section C if you still have it,  that would be great.

As far as the board layout goes, everything is finished. I had to lay small traces on top because I couldn't move the test points to
the bottom of the board. It should be fine but maybe y'all can ask Avery if you get a minute. The ground plane was made and the
number of resistors has been appropriately minimized.

Let me know if you don't like the team name. I thought it was funny since I made that mistake with your last name.

The only thing really left to do as far as design goes is to find out what the values of the resistors attached to the DIP switch block
are going to be. If y'all could figure that out and email it back to me as an excel workbook, I'll throw it in the repo.
